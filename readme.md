This package contains a JSON file with information about myself. You can use NPM to install this package and display the resume data directly in your terminal. My background is in game development, and I am currently building a career in software engineering. I bring a wide array of creative and communicative skills to the table, and I am always ready to tackle any problem. I love to make stuff, which is why my nonprofessional online handle is "MakeStuff" on every platform.
